            In the late 80s and early 90s of the 20th century, Armenia made open
            territorial claims to the historical lands of Azerbaijan and
            launched military aggression against our country. At that time,
            Armenia, taking advantage of the chaos in Azerbaijan, occupied 20%
            of our lands. The policy of ethnic cleansing pursued by Armenia
            resulted in that more than 1 million Azerbaijanis were expelled from
            their native lands.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nearly 30-year-long negotiation process on eliminating the
            consequences of military aggression against Azerbaijan and
            fulfilling UN Security Council Resolutions 822, 853, 874 and 884 has
            not yielded results due to Armenia&#39;s destructive stand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 2019, the provocative statements and steps taken by the
            Armenian military-political leadership have purposefully completely
            disrupted the negotiation process. With this, Armenia once again
            demonstrated that its real goal is to strengthen the current status
            quo and annex the territories of Azerbaijan. Aggressive and
            offensive national security strategy and military doctrine adopted
            by Armenia, expansion of the policy of illegal settlement in the
            occupied territories, call for a “new war for new territories”,
            decision to create “volunteer detachments” consisting of civilians,
            sabotage on the Armenian-Azerbaijani state border in the direction
            of Tovuz committed on July 12, 2020, at the same time, increased
            tension on the line of contact in general, concentration of its
            troops in the frontline areas, as well as collection of a large
            number of weapons and ammunition indicated that Armenia was
            preparing for a large-scale attack.

            Following the conclusion of the 2nd Nagorno-Karabakh War, a palpable
            wave of patriotism swept through the Azerbaijani populace. The
            hard-fought victory ignited a sense of national unity and pride,
            binding people together in the face of adversity. This shared
            triumph over adversity underscored the resilience of the Azerbaijani
            people and solidified their resolve to stand strong as a nation.
            Families, communities, and regions came together, fostering a
            newfound spirit of camaraderie. The war&#39;s end marked the
            beginning of a period of reconstruction and healing, with
            individuals and groups actively contributing to the nation&#39;s
            recovery efforts. This surge in patriotism was not merely a
            momentary sentiment; it laid the foundation for a more closely-knit
            Azerbaijani society, emphasizing the importance of unity and
            collective action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Expectations for the Nagorno-Karabakh region were indeed high among
            the Azerbaijani population. For many, this land held deep cultural
            and historical significance, making its liberation a momentous
            event. The idea of returning to these cherished territories was met
            with great anticipation. People eagerly looked forward to
            reconnecting with their ancestral homes, rejuvenating communities,
            and rebuilding infrastructure. The thought of revitalizing these
            regions and transforming them into prosperous and thriving paradises
            fueled a sense of optimism and purpose among the Azerbaijani
            populace.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, in Armenia, the aftermath of the war brought
            about a palpable sense of demotivation and discontent. The loss in
            the conflict was a bitter pill to swallow, and many in Armenia
            grappled with feelings of disappointment and frustration. The impact
            of the war reverberated through Armenian society, leading to
            protests and demonstrations as people sought to express their
            dissatisfaction with the outcomes. The socio-political landscape saw
            a surge in unrest, reflecting the deep emotional toll the conflict
            had taken on the Armenian population. It was a period marked by
            reflection, introspection, and a collective search for a way forward
            in the face of adversity.

            On September 27, 2020, the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia
            once again grossly violated the norms of international law, using
            various types of weapons, including heavy artillery, and fired at
            the residential areas and military positions of the Republic of
            Azerbaijan from several directions. As a result of the another
            military provocation, civilians and soldiers were killed and
            injured, and the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan started
            counter-offensive operations in order to prevent and neutralize real
            and potential military threats against the national security of the
            Republic of Azerbaijan. According to the Military Doctrine of the
            Republic of Azerbaijan, in accordance with international legal norms
            and principles, the Republic of Azerbaijan reserves the right to use
            all necessary means, including military force, to restore its
            territorial integrity due to occupation of a part of the territory
            of the Republic of Azerbaijan by the Republic of Armenia and its
            refusal to liberate the occupied lands within the political
            settlement of the problem. As an independent, democratic, legal,
            secular, unitary state capable of ensuring the national interests of
            the people and the country, the Republic of Azerbaijan determines
            and implements the national security policy for the sake of its
            development. A meeting of the Security Council was immediately held
            under the chairmanship of Ilham Aliyev, the President of the
            Republic of Azerbaijan, and certain tasks were given to provide an
            adequate response to the aggressor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the occupation by the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia
            of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the
            adjacent regions, as well as the real threat of an armed attack on
            the Republic of Azerbaijan, by the Presidential Decree dated
            September 27, 2020, from September 28, 2020 at 12 a.m. martial law
            was declared throughout the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan
            in order to bring the country, population and territory, as well as
            the Armed Forces and other armed formations, to readiness for
            defense. By the Order dated September 28, 2020, partial mobilization
            was announced in the Republic of Azerbaijan, decisions were made on
            preparations for hostilities and their conduct. As a result of the
            counter-offensive operations launched by the Armed Forces of the
            Republic of Azerbaijan, several districts of the Republic of
            Azerbaijan, as well as other strategically important territories,
            were freed from occupation from the first day. To this end, on
            September 29, 2020, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan
            signed the Decree &quot;On the organization of a temporary special
            administration in the territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan
            liberated from occupation.&quot; Based on the decree, temporary
            commandant’s offices were established in the liberated territories
            of the Republic of Azerbaijan, in accordance with the administrative
            territorial division of the Republic of Azerbaijan, which carry out
            special management for each district. Under the temporary
            commandant’s offices, operational headquarters including
            representatives of relevant state bodies (institutions) have been
            established and their duties have been defined. As a result of the
            successful military operations carried out by our brave and
            victorious Army, which liberated the Motherland from occupation, the
            armed forces of the Republic of Armenia were defeated and forced to
            retreat with heavy losses in manpower and equipment. To avenge heavy
            losses suffered on the battlefield the Armed Forces of the Republic
            of Armenia targeted the civil infrastructure facilities in the
            cities and districts remote from the conflict zone and the frontline
            zone of Azerbaijan, in particular residential buildings, hospitals,
            medical centers, school buildings, kindergartens, administrative
            buildings of state institutions, agricultural fields. The Armenian
            Armed Forces committed crimes against the peace and humanity, as
            well as war crimes by firing from various types of weapons,
            ballistic missiles, as well as prohibited artillery weapons.
            Civilians were brutally killed. Large-scale damage was caused to the
            civilian population, state property, including infrastructure
            facilities, as well as business entities.

            Thus, the second largest city of Azerbaijan, the ancient Ganja,
            which has numerous historical and cultural monuments, the cities of
            Mingachevir (hydroelectric power station) and Yevlakh (the
            Baku-Tbilisi-Jeyhan oil pipeline), where strategic facilities are
            located and through which they pass; as well as Beylagan, Barda,
            Terter, Gabala, Goranboy, Aghjabadi, Absheron, Khizi and other
            districts were fired from ballistic missiles and other heavy
            artillery installations.

            On September 27, 2020, at around 6:00 p.m., a family (5 people) was

            civilians were injured, large-scale damage was inflicted on civil
            infrastructure facilities and vehicles.

            injured , and civil infrastructure facilities and vehicles were
            heavily damaged in Barda region.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, as a result of Armenia&#39;s military aggression, 93
            civilians, including 12 children and 27 women, were killed, 454
            civilians were injured, a total of 12,292 residential and
            non-residential areas, 288 vehicles, and 1,018 farms were damaged.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the period from September 27 to November 10, 2020, Terter,
            Aghjabadi and Goranboy districts located outside the battlefield and
            the conflict zone have been shelled by Armenia for 5 times using
            prohibited and extremely dangerous phosphorus bombs at different
            times.
          </p>
          <p>
            On October 08, 03, 04 and 08 November 2020, the armed forces of
            Armenia in the occupied territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan,
            as well as the persons heading the military units located on the
            territory of the Republic of Armenia and the criminal communities
            created by them, grossly violated the requirements of the 1949
            Geneva Convention “On the Protection of Civilian Population” during
            armed conflicts. Using methods of warfare causing large-scale
            destruction, they fired artillery shells at settlements located in
            the territories of the Fizuli and Terter districts, where civilians
            or persons who did not participate in the battles densely live.
            Also, in order to cause extensive, long-term and serious damage to
            the environment and deliberate killing of people in violation of the
            basic principles of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity,
            forests with valuable and perennial trees, which are considered the
            natural wealth of the Republic of Azerbaijan, located in the
            villages of Arayatly, Alkhanly of Fuzuli districts, in Sakhlabad
            village of Terter district and in Shusha, were fired with at least
            six 122-mm artillery shells of the D-4 type, each of which contained
            3.6 kilograms of the chemical composition P-4 (white phosphorus). By
            deliberately setting fire to natural resources located in these
            areas, they caused great damage. An aggressive war was planned and
            carried out against the Republic of Azerbaijan, and terrorism was
            also committed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our soldiers and officers, who demonstrated heroism in the struggle
            for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of
            Azerbaijan, our civilians who worked in the rear, and our people as
            a whole, showed determination and will, unity and solidarity,
            rallying like a fist, dealt crushing blows to the enemy. Unable to
            withstand the victorious march of the Azerbaijan Army, the enemy
            went on provocations and committed war crimes, targeting innocent
            civilians. As a result of 44 days of hostilities, the victorious
            Azerbaijani Army liberated from occupation the cities of Jabrayil,
            Fuzuli, Zangilan and Gubadli, the city of Shusha, which occupies a
            special place in the history, culture and hearts of the Azerbaijani
            people and is considered the pearl of Karabakh, the settlements of
            Minjivan, Aghband, Bartaz of Zangilan district, the settlement of
            Hadrut and a number of villages in Khojavend district, more than 300
            settlements, including Sugovushan village, Terter district, several
            villages in the Khojaly and Lachin districts, as well as important
            strategic heights in the directions of Aghdara, Murovdagh and
            Zangilan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Brave Azerbaijani soldiers and officers, moving forward step by
            step, broke through the engineering and fortification systems built
            by Armenia over the years. Our lands were liberated at the cost of
            the blood and lives of our soldiers and officers, our martyrs.
            Azerbaijan&#39;s victories in the military field, especially the
            liberation of Shusha from occupation on November 8, played a
            decisive role in the fate of the war, thus Armenia admitted its
            defeat. According to the Statement signed on November 10, 2020 by
            the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Prime Minister of
            the Republic of Armenia and the President of the Russian Federation,
            the war ended with the victory of Azerbaijan. Armenia capitulated
            and was forced to return Kalbajar, Aghdam and Lachin districts to
            Azerbaijan.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the Presidential Decrees dated December 2, 2020, September 27 was
            declared the Day of Remembrance, and November 8 - Victory Day in the
            Republic of Azerbaijan.
          </p>
          <p>
            For almost 30 years, Armenia has mined most of the Azerbaijani lands
            occupied, even lands that do not have a military purpose. Despite
            the agreement reached in the Tripartite Statement between the
            Republic of Azerbaijan, the Republic of Armenia and the Russian
            Federation dated November 10, 2020, Armenia refuses to hand over
            maps and diagrams of minefields. In doing so, it grossly violates
            the requirements of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the basic norms
            and principles of international humanitarian law, including the
            guarantees set forth in articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention,
            article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and articles 2 (1) and 3 (2) Protocol
            No. 4 thereto. In addition to posing a threat to human life, mined
            areas also hinder the efficient use of land. Despite the fact that
            the areas have long been cleared of mines, the number of civilians
            injured and killed is increasing as a result of regularly occurring
            mine explosions. From November 10, 2020 to the present, as a result
            of mine explosions in the liberated territories, 23 civilians were
            killed and 36 civilians received injuries of varying severity.{" "}

            In the second Karabakh war, which took place in 2020 between
            Azerbaijan and Armenia, one of the significant developments was
            Azerbaijan&#39;s recapture of the strategically important city of
            Shusha. Shusha, often referred to as the cultural capital of
            Azerbaijan, had been under Armenian control for nearly three

            with cold winters and warm summers. Access to the city can be
            challenging due to its mountainous location. Roads leading to the
            city pass through rugged terrain, which has made it a strategically
            important location in the region. Its recapture marked a turning
            point in the conflict.{" "}

            Azerbaijani forces, supported by modern military equipment,
            well-executed strategies, and determined soldiers, managed to retake
            the city in a well-coordinated operation. This event not only had
            military significance but also held immense cultural and historical
            importance for Azerbaijan, as Shusha is home to many cherished
            Azerbaijani cultural landmarks. The retaking of Shusha by Azerbaijan
            had a profound impact on the overall dynamics of the war and
            eventually led to a ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia, which
            reshaped the territorial control in the region. The event
            underscored the complex geopolitical factors at play in the South
            Caucasus and highlighted the importance of diplomatic efforts to
            establish a lasting peace. While it brought a sense of triumph to
            Azerbaijan, it also brought challenges in terms of post-conflict
            reconciliation and rebuilding, emphasizing the need for dialogue and
            international cooperation to ensure stability in the region.

              The Second Karabakh War, which took place in 2020, prompted
              significant reactions from various states across the globe. As
              Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over the Nagorno-Karabakh region,
              neighboring countries like Turkey provided vocal support to
              Azerbaijan, while Russia maintained its historical ties with
              Armenia but also played a role as a mediator in the conflict.
              Other regional powers, such as Iran, expressed concern about the
              escalation and called for a peaceful resolution. Internationally,
              many nations called for an immediate ceasefire and peaceful
              negotiations to end the conflict, underlining the importance of
              stability in the South Caucasus region. The Second Karabakh War
              underscored the intricate geopolitical dynamics in the region,
              with states reacting with a mix of diplomatic efforts,
              humanitarian aid, and strategic alliances to address the ongoing
              crisis.

              Furthermore, the Second Karabakh War garnered attention from
              global superpowers, including the United States and European Union
              member states. They condemned the violence and urged both Armenia
              and Azerbaijan to cease hostilities and engage in peaceful talks.
              The conflict&#39;s implications on energy routes and regional
              stability in the South Caucasus drew the interest of international
              actors, such as the European Union, which sought to play a role in
              facilitating negotiations. Humanitarian organizations also
              mobilized to provide aid to the displaced and affected
              populations, as the war led to significant civilian casualties and
              displacement on both sides. The Second Karabakh War serves as a
              reminder of the complex challenges facing the international
              community when it comes to addressing regional conflicts and
              underscores the importance of diplomacy and conflict resolution in
              such volatile regions.
